::: tip New: Multiplayer Mode <Badge text="alpha" type="error"/>
The new "Friends" feature gives you shared sessions with your friends, family or colleagues. Simply
start a shared session using the option in the main menu and invite your guests using your host ID.
Watch the progress of everyone participating and see their answers beside the parties' statements.
All information is shared peer to peer with only a signalling server – no database involved!

::: tip Watch the talk 'Patching Democracy' now!
2020 was a great year for the project. Not only did we see the first big installment in
Northrhine-Westphalia with over 120,000 users, but on top of that were also invited to hold a
lecture at the [Remote Chaos Experience](https://rc3.world/rc3/event/rc3-40403-patching_democracy/).
You can find the talk 'Patching Democracy' here in full length: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGkGsCpC5M8>

Furthermore in the beginning of 2021 we introduced the project to the open source community at
[FOSDEM'21](https://fosdem.org/2021/). Watch the lightning talk (a shorter version of 'Patching
Democracy' focusing on the software) here: <https://video.fosdem.org/2021/L.lightningtalks/patching_democracy.webm>
